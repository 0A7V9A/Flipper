# "Pure" Tesla Charge Port Opener Files

[From the creator (fredilarsen)](https://github.com/fredilarsen/TeslaChargeDoorOpener):

<em>Iâ€™ve generated "clean" files. The ones available in every repository are RAW recordings.<br>
Those are generated files without the timing jitter or a recording.</em>

Original project was for an Arduino and an ASK STX882 transmitter. These have been converted for the Flipper!<br>
