Various SUB files I've found or created. Some tested, some not.

You can generate MANY of your own SUBs, such as MegaCode and Firefly, over at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/).

Looking to mess with garage doors? You can try the OpenSesame/deBruijn files above. (Also check out more info at [RemoteDup](https://www.ifoedit.com/RemoteDup.html), [GarageHack](https://www.ifoedit.com/garagehack.html), and [Learn Button coding](https://support.dealer.liftmaster.com/articles/Knowledge/Determine-the-Color-of-the-Learn-Button-on-Your-Garage-Door-Opener).

Remember, Flipper works on 300-348, 387-464, 779-928 freq only (hardware limit). You need an unlocked firmware with changes to hit them all. ([HINT HERE](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/1287))
