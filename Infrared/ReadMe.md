Keeping all the IR files in my fork of the [Flipper-IRDB](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB)! (Fork was moved to a [maintained one](https://github.com/logickworkshop/Flipper-IRDB).)

If you're looking for an updated tv.ir (Universal Remote file), grab the one above.

Did you know you can quickly generate your own IR files on the go at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/)?
