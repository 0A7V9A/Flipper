Keeping all the IR files in my fork of the [Flipper-IRDB](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB)! (Fork was moved to a [maintained one](https://github.com/logickworkshop/Flipper-IRDB).)

Did you know you can quickly generate your own IR files on the go at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/)?

Looking for an updated [tv.ir](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Infrared/tv.ir) (Universal Remote)? Download it with a right-click and save [from here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Infrared/tv.ir) like this:<br>
***Now with Channel/Volume controls too!*** Compiled by [Hyper_Mash](https://discord.com/channels/740930220399525928/954422774141710366/994121751023853668) with support/testing from UberGuidoZ!<br>
This has now been [merged into Unleashed](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/pull/27) and [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/releases/tag/0.61.2-0706-RMv2), currently pending [merge into Offical](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/1377) firmware.

**You might need to also place the Manifest file into the root of your SD card if you have issues with the new IR file!**

NOTE: Long pauses are normal, including 10-15 seconds of no apparent activity. It's just skipping through the "other" buttons.

Then, use qFlipper to transfer it to your Flipper and replace the existing one here:
