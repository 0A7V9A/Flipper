Keeping all that in my fork of the [Flipper-IRDB](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB)! Now updated link to a maintained one. Or generate your own at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/)!

I've also added a new project: Pronto IR codes. With a [Node.js converter](https://gist.github.com/XMB5/a877ab620d812260f2da8380aac050d3) available, hoping to turn them into IRs.
