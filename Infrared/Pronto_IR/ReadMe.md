This is a new project: Pronto IR codes. With a [Node.js converter](https://gist.github.com/XMB5/a877ab620d812260f2da8380aac050d3) available, hoping to turn them into IRs.

Thank you to bi0drainx and SkeletonMan for ideas, files, coding, and general assistance

Another project, soon. [Sirc format](http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/).
