If you've flashed firmware that doesn't seem to include the Music Player (but see it as an option), try creating a "music_player" folder on the SD (ext) and pop some tunes in! You can use RTTTL (in TXT format) or FMF (Flipper Music Format) files.

**NOTE: Make sure to put the TXT And FMF files in the root of the music_player folder for them to work!**
