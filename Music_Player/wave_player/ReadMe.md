Work in progress. Needs the [WAV Player application](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/tree/zlo/wav-player/applications/wav_player) compiled into firmware. Idea and files provided by RogueMaster.

Create a wav_player folder in the root of your SD card. You'll need 8-bit unsigned WAV files (try [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for conversion.)
