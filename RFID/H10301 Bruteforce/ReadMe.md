# H10301 Bruteforce (Thanks [gh0st91](https://github.com/gh0st91/fz)!)

Used with the RFID Fuzzer, you can load these UUIDs to try _every_ possible one.<br>
It's large and will take awhile to go through. (More for fun and testing than actual use.)

Simply extract the ZIP then copy the `H10301_BF.txt` file into the `rfidfuzzer` folder on your SD card.

Github linked above includes the Python script used to create the TXT file.
