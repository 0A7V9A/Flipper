# NFC Ramblings and Info

[Fun files](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/Fun_Files) are thing I use or things I'm playing with. <br>
Includes some basic/crude NFC documentation in the ReadMe.

`mf_classic_dict` is an [upgraded NFC keys dictionary](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/mf_classic_dict) (user/default) that almost triples the available keys.<br>
With it, you can recognize more (usually finding all 32) - now with sources and comments included!

Added [Amiibo files](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/Amiibo) due to popular request. (None were made by me!)

The HID/picopass information has been merged into Official (and 3rd party firmware) but can be [found here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/picopass) too.

You can generate your own H10301 rfid files over at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/) among MANY other things!
