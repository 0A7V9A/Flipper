Combined the stock Unleased firmware [mf_classic_dict.nfc](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/assets/resources/nfc/assets/mf_classic_dict.nfc) and all NFC keys from [Proxmark3's Iceman](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/tree/master/client/dictionaries) then removed dupes.

This has almost tripled the amount of verified keys and has been very successful in capturing all 32 under multiple tests.
