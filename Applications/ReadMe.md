## Flipper Application Packages (FAPs)

The long-awaited addition of loading plugins (applications) from the SD card is here thanks to some hard work by the Official Flipper devteam. Anna released a FAP pack with some pre-built plugins, ready to go.

And thanks to some further hard work from [xMasterX](https://github.com/xMasterX) and [Unleashed](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware), we now have MORE working applications!
