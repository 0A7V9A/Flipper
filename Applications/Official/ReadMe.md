# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for Official firmware

See the [official documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md) or **download all the files** in a [ZIP here](https://uberguidoz.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Applications/Official)!

## NOTE: Many old FAPs removed due to being broken from new API.

They will need to be compiled (again) from source to work. If you run across any not here, please PR them in! (Or tag me in Discord...)
