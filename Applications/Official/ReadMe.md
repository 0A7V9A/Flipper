# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for Official firmware

See the [official documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md) or **download all the files** in a [ZIP here](https://uberguidoz.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Applications/Official)!

## A humble thank you to [Alexei Humeniy](https://github.com/ahumeniy) for compiling the apps for the Official firmware!

They have been compiled for the current API version (5.x), but if you run across any not here, please PR them in! (Or tag me in Discord...)
