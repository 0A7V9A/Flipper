# Quick and easy flasher/updater for Marauder on the Wifi Devboard!

## Now it's as easy as 1, 2, 3 to install or update Marauder on Windows.

1. Download and extract [the ZIP file](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/raw/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher/FZ_Marauder_v1.0.zip) above to the same directory.<br>
2. Hold `BOOT` on the devboard and plug it into your PC via USB directly.<br>
3. Double-click `flash.bat` from the extracted files and choose `Install` or `Update`.

If you choose `Install` the script will locate your board and flash Marauder automatically!<br>
If you choose `Update` you'll be taken to the Marauder download location to grab a new version.<br>
(Simply download the BIN file as stated and stick it in the Marauder subfolder of the batch file.)

**Current Marauder version included in the ZIP: v0.9.13.20220806 (current at release Aug 14, 2022)**

The batch file is also included above individually for review and to track coming changes.<br>
*Coming soon: Black Magic (original debug firmware) flashing.*
